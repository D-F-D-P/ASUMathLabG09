 ## Overview
 Implement mathematical library software. Similar
to Matlab, Octave and similar tools.


 ## Project Specifications

  - Using C/C++
  - Development under linux
  - Production to linux server (Centos 6.7)
  - g++ compiler





 ## Phases

 1. Core operations 
 2. Advanced Operations and Tuning 
 3. Advanced system operations







## Phase 1: Core Operations

+ > A = [1.4 2.2 3.2; 4.4 5.4 6.4; 3.3 4.2 2.2];
+ > B = [1.5 4.1 5.4; 3.1 4.2 1.2; 3.2 4.3 2.2];
+ > C = A + B
+ > D = A - B
+ > E = A * B
+ > F = A / B
+ > G = Aâ€™




## Phase 2: Advanced Operations and Tuning

+ A = 5.5 + 12 * sin(0.4) + 2.2^4;
+ B = [1.2 2.3 A;[1.3 2.4;4.6 1.3],[3.2;7.8]];
+ C = [[B [3.4; 2.1; 3.5+9.1]]
+ 1.2^3 3+1.2 15/(2.1+10*sin(0.12)) 1.2]
+ D = rand(4,4)
+ E = eye(4, 4)
+ F = zeros(2, 3)
+ G = ones(3, 6)
+ L = (1.2 + 3.4 - 5.6)/(2.1*3.2 + 4.6) -
+ 12.1*3.1 + (1.2 + 5.2)^(4/(3.2+5.6))
+ X = ((C*D .+ 4)./2.1 + sqrt(D))./C.^2
+ Y = (C^3 * sin(1./D))^(0.1)

# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
